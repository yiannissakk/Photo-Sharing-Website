# Photo-Sharing-Website

Using Apache Tomcat and the servers of Boston University, I was able to create a photo sharing website, similar to Flickr!. That was achieved through creating java objects, integrating them with Java Server Pages (JSP) and storing the data using SQL.

The java and jsp file names are more or less self-explanatory. The files support the following functions: Upload Images, Create Albums, Add Friends, Leave Comments, Like Button, Insert Tags, Search.

The RDBS.sql file is a map of the site creating the relational database.
